# Analysis of Annaul Growth rate and death rate of Countries.

In this study we are going to look at the data which consists of crude death rate (deaths per 1000 population) of the countries and the annaul growth of the country. We will look at visual representation and see how the relationship can be seen in between these two. We also look at these graphs individually to understand the patterns and give insights.
</br>
We are going to compare how the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, China, India, South Africa) nations stand along with United States and United Kingdon. We will analyze each chart one by one.</br> </br>

### In this chart we can see that covid happened in 2020 and most countries enforced lockdowns, due to which the gdp growth is negative for all the countries. India was hit the worst with more that -7% growth and China was least affected.</br></br>

### Here is same data but with Pie chart representation, Pie chart really helps when we want to see individual contributions of limited entities. As we can see here that when all the gdp growth combined, India and Russia constitutes more than half the growth amongst these countries. </br></br>

### Soviet Union fall explains the Russian GDP growth starting in 1993, most of the countries fell in 2020 due to covid as we saw earlier. There is one more thing to note here, the United Kingdom and United States are developed nations so their gdp growth has stabalized, where as the developiong countries growth is very high. Which also means that even though their growth is lower compared to developing countries but their total gdp is way higher than these. </br></br>

## Annaul Growth for 2005 - 2020

### This is the same chart but with more details for recent years. Russia's gdp growth looks very volatile as a lot of fluctuations can be seen, we can also see that almost all countries went down in 2008 when the american economy collapsed, which tells how different countries economy is impacted when there is a recession in one of the major economies. </br></br>

### This is death rate chart of the following countries. The death rate is based on deaths per 1000 population. Russia has highest deat rate for 2018 and Brazil is at the bottom. One thing to notice here is that if we consider the population of these countries we can see a different story, for example even though India and China has less deaths per 1000 people but due to their hugh population, even a small percentage accounts for a lot more people. Russia has a small population of about 140 million but still the death rate is alarming. </br></br>
